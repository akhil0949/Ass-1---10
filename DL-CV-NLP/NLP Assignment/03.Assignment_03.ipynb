        "**Ans:** The fundamental feature of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is that the network contains at least one feed-back connection, so the activations can flow round in a loop. That enables the networks to do temporal processing and learn sequences, e.g., perform sequence recognition/reproduction or temporal association/prediction. Recurrent neural network architectures can have many different forms. One common type consists of a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) plus added loops. These can exploit the powerful non-linear mapping capabilities of the MLP, and also have some form of memory. Others have more uniform structures, potentially with every neuron connected to all the others, and may also have stochastic activation functions. For simple architectures and deterministic activation functions, learning can be achieved using similar gradient descent procedures to those leading to the back-propagation algorithm for feed-forward networks.\n",

        "In sequential tasks such as natural language and speech processing, there is always dependence of present input data upon the previous applied inputs. Task of RNNs is to find the relationship between current input and the previous applied inputs. In theory RNNs can make use of information sequence of any arbitrarily length, but in practice they are limited to looking back only a few steps.\n",

Therefore, the updated weight values are small, and the new weight values are very similar to the old weight values. This leads to Vanishing Gradient problem. We can avoid this problem using the ReLU activation function because the gradient is 0 for negatives and zero input, and 1 for positive input.\n",

        "This problem happens because of weights, not because of the activation function. Due to high weight values, the derivatives will also higher so that the new weight varies a lot to the older weight, and the gradient will never converge.
