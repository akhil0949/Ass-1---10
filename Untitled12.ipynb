        "In Python 3 and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods."

        "Ans. This is sometimes misleadingly called private attributes really, its just a way to localize a name to the class that created it, and does not prevent access by code outside the class. \n",
        "That is, this feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general."
