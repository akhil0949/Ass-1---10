        "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
        "Ans. An abstract superclass is one way to provide re-usable code. You can extend the abstract class and inherit the code. This is sometimes more convenient than using static methods or object composition to share code. \n",

        "So if you don't call base class init, none of that code would be executed and you would end up with base class that has no member variables."
